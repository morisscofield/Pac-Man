# Pac-Man Arcade Game
A fully Object-Oriented Design of the Arcade game of Pac-Man.

The Code is well commented-out and should be straight forward.
Each folder has a README file that describes what files are crucial for that particular directory

#SFML Library version 2.5.0 was used
#Entire design coded entirely in C++
